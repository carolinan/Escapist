=== Escapist ===
Contributors: poena

== Description ==
Escapist creates a list of the escaping functions found in the theme and tries to determine if the function is used correctly.
Note: The plugin is not optimised in any way, and there are false positives where lines are incorrectly marked because the plugin only checks one line at the time.

What the plugin does not do:
It does not check wether something is escaped or not.
It does not replace a manual code review. It can only help you identify files that you need to look closer at.
